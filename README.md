# Lisp_in_c
My own Lisp created using C 

In this project I am creating a flavour of Lisp using the C programming language. 
I have created it by following a book called "Build Your Own Lisp".

The motivation for the project is simple. I am using it as a means to gain a strong foundation in C.
The Lisp I am creating is not meant to be perfect programming language, it is only a tool which I am using to learn C.
